I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.sdstate.edu/mccomish-electrical-engineering-computer-science) at [South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).
In 2025, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by [Dr. Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling). In 2019, I obtained B.Sc. degree at [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.ustc.edu.cn), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn), majoring in applied mathematics. 

My primary research interests are in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, computational biology, and AI for science. 

Ongoing Research Directions:
1. Image-Based Object Pose Estimation: Focusing on both instance-level and novel object pose estimation, with an emphasis on deep geometric understanding of objects from visual inputs.
2. 3D Reconstruction and Analysis from Diverse Imaging Modalities: â€¨Developing methods for processing and analyzing diverse image modalities, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and other specialized imaging techniques.
3. Interdisciplinary Topics: Applying 3D vision algorithms to various assistive systems and utilizing AI techniques to study biological structures.

**Join the Lab:**

**I am actively seeking passionate and self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group at South Dakota State University, working on 3D computer vision tasks and interdisciplinary topics. If you are interested, please contact me at  Ruyi.Lian@sdstate.edu with your CV and transcripts.**
