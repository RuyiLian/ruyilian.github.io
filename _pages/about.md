I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.sdstate.edu/mccomish-electrical-engineering-computer-science) at [South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu).
In 2025, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by [Dr. Haibin Ling](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling). In 2019, I obtained B.Sc. degree at [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.ustc.edu.cn), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn), majoring in applied mathematics. 

My primary research interests are in the fields of computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, computational biology, and AI for science. My current research focuses on object pose estimation from images, including natural images, cryo-EM images, etc.
